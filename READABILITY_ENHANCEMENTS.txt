### File: src/pages/student/AttendancePage.jsx
**Line 189** - Replace:
className={\spect-square flex flex-col items-center justify-center rounded-xl border-2 transition-all \\}

**With:**
className={\spect-square flex flex-col items-center justify-center rounded-xl border-2 transition-all \\}

### File: src/dashboards/StudentDashboard.jsx  
**Line 120** - Ensure it has:
style={{ width: \\%\ }}

(Note: Use backticks, not quotes)
